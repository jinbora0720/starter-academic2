* Build a Bayesian model to predict effects of PM2.5 with and without wildfires.

* Include information about dynamics of wildfires and their progression into a Gaussian process (GP) using multiple directed acyclic graphs (DAG). 

* Investigate the short-term effect of PM2.5 on respiratory diseases including COVID-19.

* Develop a predictive spatial model for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in public water system (PWS) along with uncertainty quantification. 

* Identify upstream and downstream information of PWSs in relation to the nearest stream network and construct a corresponding DAG.

* *submitted*  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08405.pdf

* Adapted Bayesian heteroscedastic nonparametric regression to a multiple hypothesis testing framework.  
* Imposed a generalized latent factor model to form a non-exchangeable prior for testing. 
* Developed a matrix completion method for a latent matrix. 
* Tackled sparsity of the ToxCast data using hierarchical framework. 
* Enabled prediction for non-tested chemicalâ€™s activity. 
* Broadened the definition of activity including heteroscedasticity.
