  description = """

* Propose a computationally efficient approach to construct a well-defined spatial Gaussian process (GP) with the nonstationary covariance using multiple yet simple directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which leads to computational efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability in point-referenced geostatistical models.

* Develop “bag of DAGs,” each of which is chosen to represent a different possible dependence structure, to induce nonstationarity.

* Analyze spatiotemporal variability of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in California in which a DAG represents a prevailing wind direction causing some associated covariance in the pollutants.

* Study associations between air pollution and hospital visits related to COVID-19.

description = """

* Motivated by groundwater contamination in which pollutant measurements are collected and meaningful only in a constrained domain, i.e., groundwater bodies with intrinsic geometry.

* Develop the Barrier Overlap-Removal Acyclic Directed Graph GP (BORA-GP), a scalable GP method that incorporates the constrained domain via sparsity-inducing DAGs.  

* Enable characterization of dependence in constrained domains by removing an edge in a DAG if a linear path between two points overlaps physical barriers.

* Analyze water pollutant measurements in California collected through the Groundwater Ambient Monitoring and Assessment Program (GAMA).

description = """

* *submitted*  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08405.pdf

* Adapted Bayesian heteroscedastic nonparametric regression to a multiple hypothesis testing framework.  
* Imposed a generalized latent factor model to form a non-exchangeable prior for testing.
* Developed a matrix completion method for a latent matrix.
* Tackled sparsity of the ToxCast data using hierarchical framework.
* Enabled prediction for non-tested chemical’s activity.
* Broadened the definition of activity including heteroscedasticity.
