I'm a postdoctoral fellow working with Abhirup Datta in the department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. I received my PhD in Statistical Science from Duke University under the supervision of Amy H. Herring and David Dunson. My research interests include Bayesian hierarchical methods and spatial modeling, with a focus on environmental applications. I care about computational efficiency, model flexibility, and interpretability.
