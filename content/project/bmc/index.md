* Adapt Bayesian heteroscedastic nonparametric regression to a multiple hypothesis testing framework.  
* Impose a generalized latent factor model to form a non-exchangeable prior for testing.
* Develop a matrix completion method for a latent matrix.
* Tackle sparsity of the ToxCast data using hierarchical framework.
* Enable prediction for non-tested chemicalâ€™s activity.
* Broaden the definition of activity including heteroscedasticity.
* To appear in *Journal of the Royal Statistical Science: Series C*.
