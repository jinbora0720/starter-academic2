* Incorporate known interactions among species to increase interpretability of a joint species distribution model.
* Separate dependence in co-occurrences of multiple species into two parts: one part attributable to shared latent factors such as habitat conditions and the other attributable to between-group interactions encoded in an undirected graph.
