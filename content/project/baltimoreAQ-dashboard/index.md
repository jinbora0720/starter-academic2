* As a primary developer, co-lead a Johns Hopkins Data Science and AI Institute engineering team to
build the Baltimore AQ dashboard.

* Integrate multiple low-cost sensor networks, calibrate them against one regulatory air monitor using a GP based
Bayesian spatial model with quantified uncertainty.

* Serve high-resolution maps and summary visualizations, delivering the first spatially resolved air quality checker for
Baltimore.

* Now transitioning from historical display to near-real-time operation.
