* Aim to quantify the attribution of observed concentrations of multiple air pollutants to specific sources under a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework.

* Introduce the population-level estimand for the source attribution percentage matrix which is scale-invariant and identifiable even when NMF factors are not.
