* Aim to develop an interpretable and computational feasible method for highly multivariate (large p) and huge (large n) spatial data by utilizing relationships among variables in an inter-variable graph.

* Consider a minimum spanning tree as the backbone of the inter-variable graph.

* Transform a multivariate process into multiple bivariate processes by exploiting variable-level conditional independence specified by the minimum spanning tree.
