* Aim to develop a method for highly multivariate (large p) and huge (large n) spatial data, which infers relationships among variables through a inter-variable graph.

* Learn a backbone of the inter-variable graph defined as a minimum spanning tree of the true graph, using a Bayesian spanning tree-based approach.
